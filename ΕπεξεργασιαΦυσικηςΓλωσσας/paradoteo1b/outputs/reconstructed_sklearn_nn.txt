During our final discussion, I told him about the new submission—the one we had been waiting for since last autumn—but the updates were confusing because they did not include the full feedback from the reviewer or the editor. they really did their best on the paper and the collaboration. We should be grateful, I mean all of us, for the acceptance
and efforts until the Springer link came finally last week, I think. Also, kindly remind me please, if the doctor still plan for the acknowledgments section edit before
he sending again. Because I didn’t see that part final yet, or maybe I missed, I apologize if so. let us ensure everyone is safe and celebrate the outcome—with strong coffee and clear future goals.
