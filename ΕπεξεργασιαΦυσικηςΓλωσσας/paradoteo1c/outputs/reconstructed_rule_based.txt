Today is the Dragon Boat Festival in Chinese culture to celebrate it with all safe and great in
our lives. Hope you too, to enjoy it as my deepest wishes. Thank you for your message to show our words to the doctor, as his next contract review, to all of us. I got this message to see the approval. In fact, I have received the message from the
professor, to show me, this, a couple of days ago. I greatly appreciate the full support of the
professor, for our publication in the Springer proceedings During our final discussion, I told him about the new submission— the one we had been waiting for since
last autumn, but the updates were confusing because they did not include the full feedback from the reviewer or
or the editor Anyway, I believe the team, although a slight delay and less communication at recent days, they really
tried best for paper and cooperation. We should be grateful, I mean all of us, for the acceptance
and efforts until the Springer link finally came last week, I think. Also, kindly remind me please, if the doctor still plan for the acknowledgments section edit before
he sending again. Because I didn’t see that part final yet, or maybe I missed, I apologize if so. Overall, let us make sure all are safe and celebrate the outcome with strong coffee and future
